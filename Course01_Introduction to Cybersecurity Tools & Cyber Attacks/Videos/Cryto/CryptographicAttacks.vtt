00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.400
In this video, you
will learn to describe

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.910
the five common forms of
cryptographic attack,

3
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.925
brute force, rainbow tables,

4
00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:20.190
social engineering, known
plaintext, known ciphertext.

5
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.980
Now, we'll discuss
some cryptographic attacks.

6
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.250
Some basic cryptographic
attacks that we

7
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.860
have seen in the past
are brute force,

8
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.990
the rainbow tables, of
course social engineering,

9
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.890
known plain text, and
known ciphertext.

10
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.530
So brute force is an attack
based on trial and error,

11
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.350
and effectively would work
through submission of

12
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.200
many passwords or
fast traces to hope

13
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.440
that eventually it
will guess correctly.

14
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.630
Rainbow tables are similar,

15
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.090
but they use a limited amount

16
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.900
of information or
entity, or files,

17
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.800
and they actually contain

18
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.840
three hash passwords that we

19
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.005
can check against hash customers,

20
00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:08.645
that makes the attacks
a lot faster.

21
00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:11.710
Social engineering consists using

22
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.040
non-technical methods
to get those,

23
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.035
maybe get the password from
the end users themselves.

24
00:01:18.035 --> 00:01:21.125
The known plaintext
attack is based

25
00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:25.845
on having only plain text,

26
00:01:25.845 --> 00:01:29.130
and doing analysis based on

27
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.470
that plaint text to try to

28
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.140
understand how the cipher works,

29
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.595
and how the cipher
encrypts the information.

30
00:01:38.595 --> 00:01:42.950
This is an attempt to actually
understand and try to get

31
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.900
the actual key that is

32
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.630
used in the cipher to
encrypt the information.

33
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.130
Once you have
the key, you are able

34
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.240
to decrypt or encrypt
any information.

35
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.990
The known ciphertext is

36
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.885
the process of having
only ciphertext.

37
00:01:56.885 --> 00:01:58.790
It's similar to the
plaintext attack,

38
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.085
but with the difference that
we don't own plaintext,

39
00:02:01.085 --> 00:02:02.780
we just own ciphertext,

40
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.985
and based on that ciphertext,

41
00:02:04.985 --> 00:02:10.550
we try to defer the key used
in the cipher to again,

42
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.110
encrypt and decrypt information.
