00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.470
In this video, you will learn to;

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.390
describe the purpose or use

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.465
of cryptography in cybersecurity,

4
00:00:12.465 --> 00:00:15.780
describe how cryptography
is used to assure

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.890
the key cybersecurity tenants
of confidentiality,

6
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.820
integrity, authentication,
and non-repudiation.

7
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.940
One key concept of
security cryptography

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.330
we'll discuss this now.

9
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.995
Cryptography it's basically
a way of secret writing.

10
00:00:37.995 --> 00:00:41.720
Its a secure communication
between two parties,

11
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.195
and only the intended recipient

12
00:00:44.195 --> 00:00:46.445
can understand
this communication.

13
00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:50.960
That is the key task
of cryptography.

14
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.240
One thing that we need
to understand for

15
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.800
cryptography is that there's data

16
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.955
at motion and data at rest,

17
00:00:58.955 --> 00:01:01.355
and both of them
need to be secure.

18
00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:03.295
Cryptography is nothing new

19
00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:05.550
it has been used for
thousands of years.

20
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.300
Examples are
Egyptian Hieroglyphics,

21
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.045
the Spartan Scytale,
Ceasar Cipher,

22
00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:15.710
those are just a few examples

23
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.795
of the ancient cryptography.

24
00:01:17.795 --> 00:01:21.695
Nowadays is just more evolved.

25
00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:23.600
We have encrypting data,

26
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.700
and with the rise of computers,

27
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.235
cryptography has
evolved over the years.

28
00:01:29.235 --> 00:01:31.070
To understand better cryptography

29
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.000
and why it is important,

30
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.830
we need to discuss
some key concepts.

31
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.750
We'll start with confidentiality.

32
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.400
Basically, confidentiality

33
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.155
is the process of assuring that

34
00:01:39.155 --> 00:01:41.975
only the intended parties

35
00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:43.910
can read and understand
the message.

36
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.420
Integrity is
the process of actually

37
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.050
detecting if the message
has been changed,

38
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.010
where the message
shouldn't be altered in

39
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.905
any way in the process
of being transmitted.

40
00:01:55.905 --> 00:01:59.110
Authentication it's
the process of

41
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.120
identifying are authenticated
with someone or

42
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.270
something it's actually
not allowed to do

43
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.360
something or some message
is actually correct.

44
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.800
Non-repudiation is the process of

45
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.725
detecting if something or
someone has done something,

46
00:02:16.725 --> 00:02:19.715
and that someone one cannot deny

47
00:02:19.715 --> 00:02:24.350
that action or that message
which was sent by him or her.

48
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.320
Cryptonalysis is
basically the process of

49
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.780
analyzing ciphers in
cryptographic algorithms.

50
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.790
Cryptonalysis is
a key factor to cryptography

51
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.820
because it allows scientists and

52
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.460
mathematicians to
actually determine

53
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.735
if a cryptographic algorithm
is secure or not.

54
00:02:43.735 --> 00:02:48.645
Cipher is the actual algorithm
that encrypts a message.

55
00:02:48.645 --> 00:02:52.760
For example, the Caesar Cipher

56
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.135
was an engineers' cryptography
algorithm that basically

57
00:02:57.135 --> 00:03:01.250
shifted the alphabet or shifted

58
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.860
specific letters either to

59
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.230
the right to the left
in amount of kinds.

60
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.470
Plaintext like the word

61
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.460
says it's just plain text
can be human readable.

62
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.540
The Ciphertext
basically refers to

63
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.380
the plaintext gone
through the cipher,

64
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.880
which is basically,
the cipher has been

65
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.060
applied to a plaintext and
the ciphertext is something

66
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.760
that it's not humanly readable.

67
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.440
Encryption is the process of

68
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.020
transforming plaintext
into ciphertext.

69
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.170
Decryption is the process of
transforming the ciphertext

70
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.490
into a plaintext using

71
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.190
the cipher as well on
those two key concept.

72
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.345
Let's talk about cryptographic
strength a little bit now.

73
00:03:44.345 --> 00:03:48.575
Cryptographic strength
relies on math not secrecy.

74
00:03:48.575 --> 00:03:51.380
Keeping something
secret does not make

75
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.085
a cryptographic algorithm
anymore secure.

76
00:03:55.085 --> 00:03:58.520
Actually, the most secure
algorithms out

77
00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.780
there they have stood

78
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.225
the test of time are
public algorithms.

79
00:04:02.225 --> 00:04:05.920
Modern ciphers use modular math.

80
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.525
On the left side of the screen,

81
00:04:09.525 --> 00:04:12.150
you will see some
exclusive XOR table.

82
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.480
You will see column A, B
and the column A XOR B.

83
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.590
So trying to explain
this would be better.

84
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.690
Column A will be the plaintext,

85
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.115
column B will be

86
00:04:22.115 --> 00:04:26.120
the key that we'll use to
encrypt the information,

87
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.690
and column C will be
the resulting ciphertext.

88
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.070
If you did the other way around,

89
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.935
you'll have the column A XOR B,

90
00:04:34.935 --> 00:04:36.930
meaning you have the ciphertext,

91
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.770
and you run that on
another XOR based on column B,

92
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.900
which will be the key,
you will end up having

93
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.900
column A will choose plan
through the plaintext.

94
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.685
Now let's talk little bit
about two type of ciphers.

95
00:04:49.685 --> 00:04:52.145
There is stream cipher and
there's the block cipher.

96
00:04:52.145 --> 00:04:53.580
Stream cipher encrypt or

97
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.740
decrypt the information
bit per bit,

98
00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.060
meaning one bit at a time
on a stream manner.

99
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.960
Block ciphers they encrypt

100
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.510
or decrypt information
differently.

101
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.280
They actually use blocks

102
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.070
of bits or bits to
encrypt information.

103
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.585
Some algorithms use 64 bits

104
00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:16.940
of information to
encrypt at a time.

105
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.875
So block cipher will encrypt

106
00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:22.620
the message 64 bits at a time.
