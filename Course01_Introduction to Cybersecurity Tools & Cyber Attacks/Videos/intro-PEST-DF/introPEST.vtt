00:00:05.016 --> 00:00:09.998
In this video, you will learn
to describe penetration testing,

2
00:00:09.998 --> 00:00:15.175
why it is used, and the ethical
considerations you might run into.

3
00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:21.186
Describe the difference between white hat,
black hat, and grey hat attackers.

4
00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:27.044
Describe the several different types of
threat actors and what characterizes each.

5
00:00:27.044 --> 00:00:31.296
>> Okay for our next topic be we're going
to talk a little bit about penetration

6
00:00:31.296 --> 00:00:31.900
testing.

7
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.100
So penetration testing,
it's also called Pentest or

8
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.712
pen testing,
it's also referred as ethical hacking.

9
00:00:39.712 --> 00:00:43.342
It's basically the practice
of testing a computer system,

10
00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:47.896
a network application, either web
application or software application,

11
00:00:47.896 --> 00:00:52.380
to find security vulnerabilities that
an attacker could use to exploit and

12
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.673
gain authorized access to a system or
an application.

13
00:00:55.673 --> 00:00:59.230
The main objective of a Pentest
is to identify security

14
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.805
weaknesses before attackers can
identify them and and exploit them.

15
00:01:03.805 --> 00:01:08.446
A penetration testing it's
a practice that requires several

16
00:01:08.446 --> 00:01:11.398
contracts before it can be performed.

17
00:01:11.398 --> 00:01:15.218
For example, service level agreement,
engagement rules,

18
00:01:15.218 --> 00:01:19.994
all sorts of documentation to make
the penetration testing a legal agreement

19
00:01:19.994 --> 00:01:21.402
between two parties.

20
00:01:21.402 --> 00:01:26.136
The penetration testers are the ones in
charge of doing the technical process and

21
00:01:26.136 --> 00:01:28.300
they are also called white hackers.

22
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.100
There are different type of hackers and
we can divide them into three categories,

23
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.900
basically white hat hackers,
grey hat hackers and black cat hackers.

24
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.430
The white hat hackers, as we discussed
earlier, are basically the ethical

25
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.771
hackers, people that do this under
contract and for security reasons.

26
00:01:47.771 --> 00:01:52.710
They're authorized to perform penetration
testing on companies and they do it for

27
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.200
the good of the company.

28
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.980
Grey hat hackers they stand like in
between the white hats and the grey hats,

29
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.688
they usually performed penetration
testing without authorization, but

30
00:02:04.688 --> 00:02:08.572
they usually report back to the customer,
not the customer,

31
00:02:08.572 --> 00:02:13.300
the possible victim because they
were not contracted to do this.

32
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.843
So they were not authorized for previously
previously authorized by a company to

33
00:02:17.843 --> 00:02:22.200
perform any type of security assessment
under instructor or their network.

34
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.381
They do it anyways and
they report back to the customer or

35
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:27.417
the victim, the possible victim.

36
00:02:27.417 --> 00:02:30.780
On the other hand we have
the black hat hacker,

37
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.463
they are quote unquote the bad guys.

38
00:02:33.463 --> 00:02:39.147
They usually do these type of attacks for
personal recognition,

39
00:02:39.147 --> 00:02:43.100
money, political agenda or social change.

40
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.600
They do not do it under contract if they
are not authorized to perform any type of

41
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.500
penetration testing activity
on any of their victims.

42
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.700
We also have something
called thread actors.

43
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.900
It's basically an entity that
it's partially responsible for

44
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.400
an incident or an attack.

45
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.532
It usually affects the security
of organizations and

46
00:03:05.532 --> 00:03:09.034
they are also referred
as malicious actors.

47
00:03:09.034 --> 00:03:10.100
There are different types.

48
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.809
And with this different types there
are also different skill levels

49
00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:16.467
associated with them.

50
00:03:16.467 --> 00:03:20.146
To start with during there's
this script kiddies.

51
00:03:20.146 --> 00:03:23.487
Basically, the script kiddies
are unexperienced hackers.

52
00:03:23.487 --> 00:03:28.933
They have limited technical knowledge and
they rely on automated tools to hack.

53
00:03:28.933 --> 00:03:33.203
They do not develop their own tools and
they pretty much use what's publicly

54
00:03:33.203 --> 00:03:36.081
available with very little
technical knowledge.

55
00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:37.748
We have also the hacktivist.

56
00:03:37.748 --> 00:03:44.477
These type of hackers they are usually
have a political agenda or

57
00:03:44.477 --> 00:03:49.098
a some sort of social
change in their minds.

58
00:03:49.098 --> 00:03:51.072
There are also organized crime.

59
00:03:51.072 --> 00:03:55.963
These are usually external
to the do the company.

60
00:03:55.963 --> 00:04:01.400
They're highly sophisticated, meaning
they have very high technical knowledge.

61
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.839
They are also heavily funded from
an economical standpoint and

62
00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:13.185
they are usually attacking
from some sort of a highly

63
00:04:13.185 --> 00:04:18.300
developed malware like
Ransomware in nowadays.

64
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:24.134
Insiders, they represent past or present
employees, contractors, partners or

65
00:04:24.134 --> 00:04:29.736
any entity that has access to a company
property or confidential information.

66
00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:33.846
The insiders can be a security risk for
intentionally or

67
00:04:33.846 --> 00:04:36.907
unintentionally basically an insider or

68
00:04:36.907 --> 00:04:42.153
an employee could be fired from
the company for example, and they could

69
00:04:42.153 --> 00:04:47.592
be motivated to perform some sort of
disruption activity on the company.

70
00:04:47.592 --> 00:04:52.707
They are could also be unintentionally
an employee may be deleting some

71
00:04:52.707 --> 00:04:57.991
sort of some sort of information that
is not to be supposed to be deleted but

72
00:04:57.991 --> 00:05:02.788
they made a mistake and
they deleted that information by mistake.

73
00:05:02.788 --> 00:05:04.915
We also have the competitors.

74
00:05:04.915 --> 00:05:12.033
A competitor could be a potential security
risk to other organizations because they

75
00:05:12.033 --> 00:05:18.665
they could be motivated by maybe releasing
a product before the competition.

76
00:05:18.665 --> 00:05:22.290
And finally we have the nation states.

77
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.729
Nation states are external to the company.

78
00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.552
They are also highly sophisticated.

79
00:05:28.552 --> 00:05:33.821
They are very well economically funded,
they could be something

80
00:05:33.821 --> 00:05:40.100
related to politics, military,
technical or economic agendas.

81
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.201
We have a few examples of some
nation-state threat actors.

82
00:05:45.201 --> 00:05:48.173
The Fancy Bear, also called ATP28.

83
00:05:48.173 --> 00:05:53.444
Lazarus Group, Scarcruft also called
accrued Group 123 or the APT29.

84
00:05:53.444 --> 00:05:59.800
These are all examples of nation
state funded hacking organizations.
