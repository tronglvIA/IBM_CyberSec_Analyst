00:00:05.537 --> 00:00:09.664
In this video, you will learn to
describe the methodologies used

2
00:00:09.664 --> 00:00:13.920
in penetration testing,
including the following.

3
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.760
Open Source Security Testing Methodology,
National Institute of Standards and

4
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.010
Technology Guidelines on
network security testing.

5
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.850
Federal Financial Institutions
Examination Council,

6
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.350
Information Technology Examination.

7
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.715
Information System Security
Assessment Framework.

8
00:00:37.012 --> 00:00:39.727
>> Let' talk about, now,
pen testing methodologies.

9
00:00:39.727 --> 00:00:43.690
So when we talk about
pentest methodologies,

10
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.094
we're talking about a process for
offensive cyber security consultant,

11
00:00:50.094 --> 00:00:56.410
to a perform a series of actions in
order to try to exploit a system.

12
00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.900
But the exploitation process actually is
one of the key parts of the methodology.

13
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.736
It's something that will give you a clear
understanding of how the company,

14
00:01:07.736 --> 00:01:13.682
how you're victim, or your client,
is dealing with the cyber security war.

15
00:01:13.682 --> 00:01:17.540
You're still in with the cyber security
defenses and monitory processes.

16
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:25.380
So let's understand first a couple of
methodologies that are on the public

17
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.760
knowledge, or are in the environment for
you to understand and follow.

18
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.050
So we have the OSSTMM methodology,

19
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.625
the Open Source Security
Testing Methodology Manual.

20
00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:43.205
Then we have the NIST, a methodology for
a network security testing.

21
00:01:43.205 --> 00:01:48.930
There is another one called the Federal
Financial Institution Examination Council

22
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.890
for Information Technology Examination.

23
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.870
And then we have the ISSAF, Information
System Security Assessment Framework.

24
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.025
There is another pentest
methodology called a PTES.

25
00:02:02.025 --> 00:02:08.770
Actually if we go here on Google
to PTES Technical Guidelines,

26
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.267
the actual URL is
www.pentest-standard.org.

27
00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:18.480
If you go here,
you will see a lot of things,

28
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.580
you will see a lot of information from
the pen testing methodology perspective.

29
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.780
But in order for
you to be able to read this methodology,

30
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.070
actually is one of the simplest
methodology out there, it's simple.

31
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.420
Just understand that here
you will have the phases.

32
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.820
So each of these is a phase
that you will need to explore,

33
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.970
you will need to perform
on your pen test project.

34
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.050
So, for example,

35
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.020
when you are in the Intelligence Gathering
process, you can click here.

36
00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.690
And you will have a lot
of things to perform,

37
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.200
in order to you get enough
knowledge from your target.

38
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.270
So, in the real world,
if you work as a pen tester,

39
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.340
as an ethical hacker, the first step and
the most important step that you could do

40
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.990
is the information gathering process,
the enumeration process.

41
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.140
Understand all the attack surface from
your client, understand all the possible

42
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.320
exploits, all the older possible systems
that you could exploit on your target.

43
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.840
So, normally, there is a misconception
because, in some occasions,

44
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.405
the people things that a pen tester
will just go and open something called

45
00:03:42.405 --> 00:03:46.975
metasploit and start are working with
comments and exploits and that's all.

46
00:03:46.975 --> 00:03:49.905
I mean, that's not the real world,
on the real world,

47
00:03:49.905 --> 00:03:53.315
you will need to get a lot of
information from your target.

48
00:03:53.315 --> 00:03:57.265
A lot of enumeration, a lot of
information gathering from your target in

49
00:03:57.265 --> 00:04:00.985
order to proceed with the other phases.

50
00:04:00.985 --> 00:04:05.780
Then when you have enough information,
you could go and

51
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.940
start your Threat Modeling process.

52
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.566
So you have all the information for
your target, now what?

53
00:04:11.566 --> 00:04:16.561
Now you need to understand
what will be your roadmap,

54
00:04:16.561 --> 00:04:22.580
sorry, in order for you to exploit or
attack your target.

55
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.530
Here is just some examples,
or checklists, or

56
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.790
things that you could
start doing on your end.

57
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.850
In order to understand which
part of the organization,

58
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.290
which part of the network
that you already understand.

59
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.032
Because you already performed
the information gathering process, but

60
00:04:40.032 --> 00:04:43.655
you'll start exploring more
deeply in the next step.

61
00:04:43.655 --> 00:04:47.180
The next step, actually,
is the Vulnerability Analysis.

62
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.300
In some occasions, as a pen testers,

63
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.840
we use vulnerability scanners,
the Vulnerability Assessment Tools.

64
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.730
For understanding a little bit better,

65
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.310
which vulnerabilities are more likely
to be exploitable in the system.

66
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.990
So, for example, if we have something on
port 80, and we already know that that

67
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:15.570
thing on port 80 is a web page running on
Apache Server Version 2.6, for example.

68
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.940
One of the things that we could do
is try to perform an exploration

69
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.560
regarding vulnerabilities that will
affect that version of Apache Server.

70
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.490
So we could use
a Vulnerability Assessment Tool,

71
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.426
we could use something called,
for example, OpenVAS.

72
00:05:31.426 --> 00:05:32.780
We can use Qualys,

73
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.050
we can use Nessus, there is a lot of
Vulnerability Assessment Tools over there.

74
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.932
But one of the things that also it's
important for you to understand,

75
00:05:39.932 --> 00:05:46.040
you could also explore the vulnerabilities
using a manual process.

76
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.670
So one of the things that you
could do is just go to Google.

77
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.760
And if you have the version of the system,
just go and

78
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.770
type exploit apache 2.4, for example.

79
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.770
And you will have a lot of information
about vulnerabilities that will

80
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.890
affect that specific
version of Apache Server.

81
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.760
And you could start trying to exploit
those vulnerabilities in the next step.

82
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.210
The next step, actually,
is the Exploitation step.

83
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.033
So when you are in the Exploitation,
you will need, first of all,

84
00:06:22.033 --> 00:06:26.705
to understand that you as a pen tester,
or as an ethical hacker.

85
00:06:26.705 --> 00:06:28.217
You cannot, you cannot,

86
00:06:28.217 --> 00:06:33.050
again, you cannot exploit any system if
you don't have the permission to do that.

87
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.351
You need to coordinate with your client,

88
00:06:38.351 --> 00:06:43.015
you need to coordinate with your victim
[LAUGH] the time frame, time windows,

89
00:06:43.015 --> 00:06:46.264
in order to perform the exploit
of the systems, why?

90
00:06:46.264 --> 00:06:49.485
Because what happen if
you exploit something,

91
00:06:49.485 --> 00:06:54.651
if you exploit the Apache web server
that we were talking about minutes ago.

92
00:06:54.651 --> 00:06:57.057
In a time where your victim,

93
00:06:57.057 --> 00:07:02.760
your client is performing some
important actions on the Web page.

94
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.060
For example, in a high season of sales for

95
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.540
that client that will
take over the Internet.

96
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:14.790
So, if you exploit the system and you,
not just get access into the system,

97
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:21.650
but you also broke the system because
you perform a denial of service attack.

98
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.930
You probably will have problems because

99
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.600
the normal operation of
the client it's affected for you.

100
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:36.090
So that's an important part for
any pen tester to understand.

101
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:40.670
Coordination, talk with your client,
operation,

102
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:46.390
try to coordinate all the operations from
the Exploitation phase is a key part.

103
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:52.070
But, again, on this PTES or
Pen Test Standard methodology that we're

104
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.070
seeing here, there is a lot of things
that you need to have in mind.

105
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.940
So, for example,

106
00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:02.040
if you want to send a payload with
a reverse connection to your system.

107
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.780
Probably you'll need to deal with
something called evasion or obfuscation,

108
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:10.780
to try to avoid antivirus detection,
for example.

109
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.550
Or if you want to encrypt your payload or
your attack,

110
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:20.320
you could start doing something
that will encrypt your connection.

111
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:25.006
For example,
using NetGuard with encryption.

112
00:08:25.006 --> 00:08:30.000
Or using other tools that are not
necessarily encrypted, but

113
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.150
will use encryption portal or
use ports that are open on the system.

114
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.950
And, lastly, we have
the Post Exploitation and Reporting.

115
00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.170
Again, the Post Exploitation is what
happened when you already have access

116
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:44.700
to the system.

117
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:49.390
How could you maintain the access,
how could you start doing some pivoting?

118
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:53.420
In other words, how could you start
jumping from computer to computer?

119
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.890
Or how could you start doing something
that we call privilege escalation?

120
00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.500
And the most important part here,
Reporting.

121
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.335
How could you show your client,
how do you perform

122
00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:08.283
each of the steps of the project,
and gain access to the system.
