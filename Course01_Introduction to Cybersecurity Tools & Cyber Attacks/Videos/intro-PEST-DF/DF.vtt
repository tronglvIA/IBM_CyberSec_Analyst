00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.297
In this video, you will learn to describe
the practice of digital forensics and

2
00:00:10.297 --> 00:00:15.910
what technical skills and legal
knowledge is required to be effective.

3
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.930
>> We move now on to
the digital forensics area.

4
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.820
So digital forensics,
is a branch of forensic science.

5
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.410
It basically includes everything relate to
identification, recovery, investigation,

6
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.870
validation, and presentation of
facts regarding digital evidence.

7
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.470
There's digital evidence, it's usually
found on computers or similar digital

8
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:46.120
storage media devices, for example,
hard drives, cell phones, servers.

9
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.510
If we talk about forensic science,

10
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.965
we need to talk about
the Locard's exchange principle.

11
00:00:50.965 --> 00:00:57.440
Dr. Edmond Locard is a pioneer
in the forensic science scene.

12
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.970
And he became known as
the Sherlock Holmes of France.

13
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.210
He came up with this principle,
that is true for

14
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.410
both the physical world as well as
the technical world or the computer world.

15
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.910
The perpetrator of a crime will bring
something into the crime scene and

16
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.820
leave with something from it.

17
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.520
And that both can be used
as forensics evidence.

18
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.680
Basically this means that when
anybody commits a crime, he will take

19
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.080
something from the crime, but he will
also leave something in the crime scene.

20
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.200
And those two facts can be used for
forensics evidence.

21
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.570
In digital forensics,
we need to talk about chain of custody,

22
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.030
just as we will in the forensic science.

23
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.270
Basically refers to
the chronological documentation or

24
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.350
paper trail that records the sequence
of custody, control, transfer,

25
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.230
analysis, and disposition of physical or
electronic evidence.

26
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.390
So the chain of custody, basically
it's a written document that will

27
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.630
allow us to reconstruct what have
been done with the evidence.

28
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.132
Who has had it in the past,
who has copied the information,

29
00:02:08.132 --> 00:02:12.473
how it was copied, who has analyzed
the information, all sorts of things.

30
00:02:12.473 --> 00:02:17.730
And chain of custody will be able to
tell us that or recreate that for us.

31
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.590
This chain of custody process have
been required, it is required for

32
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.650
any type of evidence to be
presented legally in court.

33
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.704
In digital forensics,
we have several tools there.

34
00:02:31.704 --> 00:02:35.450
We can divided them into two,
hardware tools and software tools.

35
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.770
In hardware tools,
we have a few samples of the Faraday cage,

36
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.690
it's basically a device that
can block any electronic.

37
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.800
It basically blocks magnetic fields.

38
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.710
And it's used to isolate cellphones,
for example,

39
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.620
from the cellular data, wi-fi access.

40
00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.000
So isolate the cellphone from any,
impulse or any electronic communication.

41
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.740
We also have a specific forensics tools or

42
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.340
forensics briefcase that have
a bunch of tools inside of them.

43
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.164
We can discuss them maybe it's
forensics laptops, power supplies,

44
00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:21.346
tool sets, digital cameras,
case folders, blank forms.

45
00:03:21.346 --> 00:03:25.799
Basically these blank forms are what
would then constitute the chain

46
00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.900
of custody of any evidence
collected during the investigation.

47
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.620
Also we would need some empty hard drives
if we need to copy any information.

48
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.770
And also the write blockers because we
want to make sure that we're able to copy

49
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.730
anything from the hard drives but we're
not writing anything into the hard drives.

50
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.530
We have several software
tools out there and

51
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.790
these are just some very small list of
anything that's available out there.

52
00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.540
We have open sourcing
applications like Volatility and

53
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.030
we also have paid software like FTK and
EnCase.

54
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.490
In the case of dd, it is basically

55
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.370
a bit-by-bit copier found in most of
the Linux operating systems out there.

56
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.170
Autopsy, Bulk Extractor, and

57
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:22.339
many more are some of the tools that can
be used in any forensics investigation.
