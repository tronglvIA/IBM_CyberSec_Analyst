00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.390
In this video, you will learn to

2
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.065
describe the vulnerability
assessment methodologies.

3
00:00:11.065 --> 00:00:16.410
There is something
I mentioned before,

4
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.569
we normally use in the
pen testing world or scenarios,

5
00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:25.060
but it could be something
that is separate from

6
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.160
the pen testing world and

7
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.785
this is vulnerability
assessment test.

8
00:00:29.785 --> 00:00:32.140
So as I mentioned there is tools

9
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.360
that will exploit or will try

10
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.520
to give us vulnerabilities for

11
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.145
each of the systems that
we are dealing with.

12
00:00:39.145 --> 00:00:42.070
So for example when we

13
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.280
have a system and we know
that that system runs on port

14
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.795
80 again Apache server on
the version 2.4 for example,

15
00:00:51.795 --> 00:00:54.590
we could start
understanding each of

16
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.735
the exploits doing
a manual search but,

17
00:00:57.735 --> 00:01:00.930
we can use open badge for example

18
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.210
to perform a automated
vulnerability assessment.

19
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.570
So the tool will be run on the on

20
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.050
the network from
your client and will

21
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.640
give us a lot of information

22
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.410
from possible exploits
that we could

23
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.160
use as band testers to
gain access to the system.

24
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.200
Now the important part of

25
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.795
the vulnerability assessment
methodology is

26
00:01:23.795 --> 00:01:27.510
the vulnerability assessment
finish with the report,

27
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.140
finish with understanding
of the vulnerability.

28
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.450
The vulnerability
assessment report will

29
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.135
not exploit the vulnerability
identified on the system.

30
00:01:39.135 --> 00:01:41.235
So only will give us the report,

31
00:01:41.235 --> 00:01:44.915
only will give us
the information to exploit

32
00:01:44.915 --> 00:01:46.730
that vulnerability but will

33
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.265
not exploit the
vulnerability itself.

34
00:01:49.265 --> 00:01:51.680
So that's the next step if we're

35
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.560
dealing with a pen testing
methodology but if we're

36
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.480
talking about
vulnerability assessment

37
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.640
we're just dealing
with information that

38
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.080
could harm a system or could
be used to exploit a system,

39
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.720
not necessarily the
exploitation process

40
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.850
or that Bose
exploitation process.

41
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.895
That's something
important to understand.

42
00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:13.850
So here is a weaker
scenario recommended

43
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.675
by some companies or
followed by song companies.

44
00:02:17.675 --> 00:02:19.775
So the vulnerability
assessment or

45
00:02:19.775 --> 00:02:22.205
the vulnerability scanning
could be done

46
00:02:22.205 --> 00:02:24.230
quarterly or bi-monthly or

47
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.865
bi-weekly or on
monthly basis, why?

48
00:02:27.865 --> 00:02:30.330
Because normally something
automated is something

49
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.850
that it's already
configured in a system,

50
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.305
it's already configuring
a tool and will be running

51
00:02:36.305 --> 00:02:41.345
automatically on a regular basis
on the internal network.

52
00:02:41.345 --> 00:02:42.755
So when we have

53
00:02:42.755 --> 00:02:45.560
all the information regarding
vulnerability scanners,

54
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.040
we could start trying to patch

55
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.315
the systems or adding
security into the systems

56
00:02:53.315 --> 00:02:54.950
for the vulnerabilities or

57
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.140
the exploits not be
longer available

58
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.190
for attackers to get off
access on the system.

59
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.950
Now to start or to test that

60
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.860
we're doing the
correct patching or

61
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.190
the correct
sanitisation of each of

62
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.900
the vulnerabilities that we

63
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.075
detect on the
vulnerability scanning,

64
00:03:14.075 --> 00:03:17.420
normally we perform
a penetration testing process.

65
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.100
This could be done
annually for example,

66
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.300
in some occasions one or two

67
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.270
times per year it's
important or is

68
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.849
recommended but this case

69
00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.780
the pen testers will take
not just the vulnerabilities

70
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.220
that you already know that

71
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.870
you have but probably will take

72
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.394
some additional exploits
or techniques,

73
00:03:39.394 --> 00:03:41.960
for example the social
engineering techniques,

74
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.165
to try to exploit your systems.

75
00:03:44.165 --> 00:03:47.765
So this is something that
will be manually made.

76
00:03:47.765 --> 00:03:51.895
I mean there is
companies that will

77
00:03:51.895 --> 00:03:59.360
bring consultants to deploy
or to execute pen testing.

78
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.410
In the vulnerability
assessment scenario,

79
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.320
there is not necessarily
a consultant but could be

80
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.020
a system generated information

81
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.760
on the vulnerable list
that you have.
