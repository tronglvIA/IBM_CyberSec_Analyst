00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.315
In this video, you will learn
to describe what is meant

2
00:00:09.315 --> 00:00:14.770
by Non-Repudiation and how
it applies to the CIA Triad.

3
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.080
Another key term that we need to

4
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.465
understand is something
called Non-Repudiation.

5
00:00:21.465 --> 00:00:23.420
Non-Repudiation is pretty simple.

6
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.285
It's actually about the proof
that the identity of

7
00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:31.290
the data sender or
the data receiver

8
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.330
is not modify, is not altered.

9
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.070
Not even on the transit,

10
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.400
but in the origin of the data.

11
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.530
So for example, how could
we use something or how

12
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.310
could we implement
some technology

13
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.845
that will allow us to understand.

14
00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:53.680
If somebody send an e-mail,

15
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.935
that person is
actually that person,

16
00:00:55.935 --> 00:00:58.755
is not an attacker

17
00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:02.030
from another country trying

18
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.920
to impersonate the person
that sent the e-mail.

19
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.765
So that's something that we

20
00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:09.975
normally implement with
digital signatures.

21
00:01:09.975 --> 00:01:15.390
Obviously, for example,
this specific scenario,

22
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.180
if we go to our mail server,

23
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.790
we could also go to the
logs and see if somebody,

24
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.740
for example, if
Kenneth send an e-mail

25
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.910
to his boss saying that he quit.

26
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.700
So if there is no locks,

27
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.270
if there is no
digital signature on

28
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.140
the receiver side that

29
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.710
says that Kenneth
send this e-mail,

30
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.060
that should be something
important to keep in

31
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.970
mind for the
Non-Repudiation concept.

32
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.400
So as soon as Kenneth's boss

33
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.890
goes to Kenneth's
office and says,

34
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.275
"Hey, are you really
quitting here?"

35
00:01:50.275 --> 00:01:52.480
That's something that this

36
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.320
now Kenneth could
say like, "Hey, no.

37
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.080
I'm actually not
sending those e-mails.

38
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.790
Somebody is trying
to impersonate."

39
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.140
So that's something that

40
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.790
we're going to talk
about in the future,

41
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.414
how could we use encryption,

42
00:02:07.414 --> 00:02:08.555
how could we use

43
00:02:08.555 --> 00:02:11.120
our public key infrastructure

44
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.279
to generate digital signatures,

45
00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:16.925
and how could we understand
logs in different systems.

46
00:02:16.925 --> 00:02:18.470
But at this moment,

47
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.865
it's important to understand

48
00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:22.950
this concept, the
Non-Repudiation concept.
