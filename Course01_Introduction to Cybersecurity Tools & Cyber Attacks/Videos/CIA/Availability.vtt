00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.940
In this video, you will learn
to describe what is meant

2
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.635
by availability in
the context of the CIA triad.

3
00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:17.115
The last one it's
for availability.

4
00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:19.560
Availability means,
and actually we

5
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.500
deal with availability every day,

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.720
it means that any data should

7
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.260
be available always
when it's needed.

8
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.750
So a clear example of
a lack of availability is,

9
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.105
do not have any kind of backups

10
00:00:36.105 --> 00:00:39.015
for our data for our systems.

11
00:00:39.015 --> 00:00:40.730
So what happens when

12
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.610
a cyber attack for
example occurs and

13
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.890
somebody download ransomware in

14
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.430
our network and all the
data from our computers,

15
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.830
from our servers are
erased or are encrypted?

16
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.350
Well, the easiest thing to do

17
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.470
actually is go to our
backup and restore

18
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.290
the data using
the last available backup

19
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.650
available or using
the last backup

20
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.060
that we have on our system,

21
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.150
and restore everything,
and continue our life,

22
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.780
continue our work as
nothing happened.

23
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.330
But in some occasions,

24
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.810
these processes storing a
backup or generating backups,

25
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.340
it's something that is none

26
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.235
neccesarilly common in
most of the enterprises.

27
00:01:25.235 --> 00:01:29.490
So some technical implementation
that we could use

28
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.765
to implement or add

29
00:01:33.765 --> 00:01:37.605
availability in
our systems are rates.

30
00:01:37.605 --> 00:01:40.275
Rates are like this arrangement.

31
00:01:40.275 --> 00:01:42.350
These technologies use something

32
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.880
that for example will allow

33
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.970
us to keep or to install
two, three, four,

34
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.770
even naturally handle thousands

35
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.305
of hard drives in our
servers in our systems,

36
00:01:53.305 --> 00:01:55.655
to backup or to add

37
00:01:55.655 --> 00:02:00.080
redundancy into our
servers for our data.

38
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.430
So for example, if we have

39
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.045
four different drives
in our file server,

40
00:02:05.045 --> 00:02:07.925
and OneDrive goes down because

41
00:02:07.925 --> 00:02:11.865
a mechanical part broken, well,

42
00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:12.890
it doesn't matter, we have

43
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.870
three different drives that has

44
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.760
the same information and we

45
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.025
could maintain
the access to our data.

46
00:02:19.025 --> 00:02:23.150
Clusters are technology
that allow us

47
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.305
to maintain a different set
of servers working as one.

48
00:02:27.305 --> 00:02:29.855
So it's something
similar as rates,

49
00:02:29.855 --> 00:02:33.320
but on clusters we're not
the only with hard drives,

50
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.275
we're dealing with servers.

51
00:02:36.275 --> 00:02:38.810
ISP redundancy
obviously something

52
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.270
important or what
happens if we only have

53
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.595
one Internet connection
to our company

54
00:02:43.595 --> 00:02:45.365
and something happened and

55
00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:47.455
that Internet
connection goes down,

56
00:02:47.455 --> 00:02:49.610
well, such important is in

57
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.105
these days when we are using
a lot of things on Cloud,

58
00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:56.975
probably it's a good idea to
have an ex or a second ISP

59
00:02:56.975 --> 00:03:02.150
to have Internet in our company.

60
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.105
Obviously backups,

61
00:03:04.105 --> 00:03:07.370
we already talked
about backups and are

62
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.770
the important things that we
need to keep in mind as soon

63
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.320
as we work with backups
and restore data.
