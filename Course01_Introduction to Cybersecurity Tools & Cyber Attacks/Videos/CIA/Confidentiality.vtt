00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.940
In this video you will learn
to describe what is meant by

2
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.080
confidentiality in
the context of the CIA triad.

3
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.210
In this video we're
going to talk about

4
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.210
the key concepts on the
cybersecurity word,

5
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.250
especially something related to

6
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.525
a term that is commonly
known as the CIA triad.

7
00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.090
First, we need to understand that

8
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.315
this three letters all means
everything in cybersecurity.

9
00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:33.270
The meaning of each
of these letters are

10
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.510
actually this C for
confidentiality,

11
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.950
I for integrity, and
A for availability.

12
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.710
Confidentiality is
actually pretty simple.

13
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.160
We deal with confidentiality
almost everyday,

14
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.290
and it means that we're going

15
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.635
to keep the data,
keep the system,

16
00:00:53.635 --> 00:00:56.135
keep our technology asset

17
00:00:56.135 --> 00:00:58.805
or technological assets
confidential,

18
00:00:58.805 --> 00:01:01.865
or prevent any disclosure of

19
00:01:01.865 --> 00:01:03.200
confidential data or

20
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.000
confidential access
from this computer,

21
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.355
this system, that document,
to non-authorized parties.

22
00:01:11.355 --> 00:01:15.500
For example, one
confidential data that we'd

23
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.180
normally use are
our personal information,

24
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.380
on not necessarily
all the people that we

25
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.455
know needs to understand
or needs to know

26
00:01:24.455 --> 00:01:27.710
all the data that we
keep confidential on

27
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.345
our computers and our cell phone
or something like that.

28
00:01:32.345 --> 00:01:37.430
So in order to implement
confidentiality in our work,

29
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.005
in the cybersecurity ward,

30
00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:40.490
we normally use encryption.

31
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.230
On encryption,
we're going to talk

32
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.885
about encryption
in another video,

33
00:01:44.885 --> 00:01:47.510
but encryption means
that we are going

34
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.120
to use a cipher in order to

35
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.160
prevent any
confidential data to be

36
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.985
exposed to the public
or to non-authorized.

37
00:01:55.985 --> 00:01:59.045
All the key elements
that allow us to

38
00:01:59.045 --> 00:02:02.210
implement confidentiality
are for example,

39
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.375
authentication, access
control, physical security,

40
00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:08.615
things that will allow us to

41
00:02:08.615 --> 00:02:13.850
maintain any certain level
of restriction to our data,

42
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.230
to our systems, to
our technology and our assets.
