00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.490
In this video, you
will learn to describe

2
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.540
how antivirus and
anti-malware programs detect,

3
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.550
block, and remove viruses and

4
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.025
malware from infected systems.

5
00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:18.750
Describe the purpose of

6
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.225
malware definitions
or signatures.

7
00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:22.680
Next time, we will discuss

8
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.540
a little bit about
anti-virus and anti-malware.

9
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.890
So an antivirus is a specialized

10
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.990
software that can detect,

11
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.215
prevent, and even destroy
computer viruses or malware.

12
00:00:33.215 --> 00:00:36.815
This specialized software
use model with definitions.

13
00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:38.990
They're basically
like signatures for

14
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.770
identifying malicious
software or malware.

15
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.530
Those smaller definitions are

16
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.620
constantly being updated
by vendors and usually

17
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.230
the vendors are the ones that
send out these updates or

18
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.610
these smaller model definition to

19
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.355
the antivirus software itself.

20
00:00:56.355 --> 00:00:59.250
They basically scan
the systems and

21
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.440
they search for matches

22
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.790
against those
smaller definitions.

23
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.925
So for example, we get
one file infected,

24
00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:08.750
you will actually match
a hash for example,

25
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.185
a md5 hash that it's already
recognizes a malware.

26
00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:13.985
So the empty virus will either

27
00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:16.100
delete that file, put
it in quarantine,

28
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.745
or just file and you user it to

29
00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.370
alert the new user that this file

30
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.285
is infective or
might be infective.

31
00:01:22.285 --> 00:01:25.040
Antivirus can sit locally

32
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.930
on a computer like
a whole antivirus.

33
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.795
The goals with be
a narrower anti-virus system.

34
00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:32.170
The most common one
that we'll encounter,

35
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.270
it's a host-based
anti-virus system

36
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.180
that is actually connected
to a centralized server.
