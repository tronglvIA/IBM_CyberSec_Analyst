00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.060
In this video, you will learn

2
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.970
to describe various methods of

3
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.610
ensuring effective
access management

4
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.985
to an organizations
computing resources.

5
00:00:15.985 --> 00:00:18.865
So we're going to go
over some key concepts.

6
00:00:18.865 --> 00:00:21.155
Now we're going to talk
about authorization.

7
00:00:21.155 --> 00:00:24.490
Authorization is the process of

8
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.285
allowing somebody to
access a specific object.

9
00:00:28.285 --> 00:00:30.745
There are different type
of criteria.

10
00:00:30.745 --> 00:00:35.885
You could restrict
access by groups,

11
00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:38.300
by time frame or specific dates,

12
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.395
also by physical location
or transaction type.

13
00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:43.720
What this means
basically we can do,

14
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.090
it could allow in this case
subjects or people to access

15
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.075
objects or files or directory
based on specific groups.

16
00:00:51.075 --> 00:00:53.240
For example, the administrator
group will have access

17
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.750
to more data than
for example somebody

18
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.020
on a different group
such as maybe

19
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.850
a financial person in

20
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:02.900
a different group like

21
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.805
a financial group or
something like that.

22
00:01:04.805 --> 00:01:08.075
You can also restrict
access by time frame

23
00:01:08.075 --> 00:01:13.255
mean from eight to five people
can access deleted files,

24
00:01:13.255 --> 00:01:16.505
but any attempt to
access those files

25
00:01:16.505 --> 00:01:20.940
outside those time frames
will be denied.

26
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.230
Also specific date, let's
say Monday to Friday,

27
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.375
those will be the date that

28
00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:29.420
the people working on set will

29
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.425
be allowed to access those files.

30
00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:35.900
You can also restrict
the access to

31
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.000
a specific objects or

32
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.490
files of actions again
by physical location.

33
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.220
So for example, you want
people only located in

34
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.240
the USA to access
those files or you

35
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.580
want people only outside
the USA to access

36
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.825
this type of files or
a specific information.

37
00:01:53.825 --> 00:01:57.920
You can also restrict the access
through transactions.

38
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.500
You don't want people to write on

39
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.470
specific files or
maybe you want people

40
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.480
to be able to read those files.

41
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.115
We need to talk about
Need to Know as well.

42
00:02:10.115 --> 00:02:13.520
The Need to Know is
the justification

43
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.165
for somebody to request
access to a specific data.

44
00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:20.120
If my specific job

45
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.745
or my job duties require
me to know something

46
00:02:22.745 --> 00:02:24.335
and maybe that will be

47
00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:26.165
the justification for me to

48
00:02:26.165 --> 00:02:29.320
have access to a specific files
and directories.

49
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.760
In all of this, is basically a

50
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.695
centralized on something
that's called Single Sign-on.

51
00:02:34.695 --> 00:02:39.175
It's a very what you
use on enterprises.

52
00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:42.010
What this does is you
basically you login

53
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.260
once and the Single Sign-on
will allow you

54
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.960
access to websites or to

55
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.490
different parts
with just a single

56
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.610
one time login process.

57
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.670
There are some
authentication concepts

58
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.875
that we need to understand.

59
00:02:56.875 --> 00:02:59.650
First of all, it's
the identity proofs.

60
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.630
On most systems they will ask you

61
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.220
for an identity and
authentication.

62
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.360
To put an example, the username

63
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.830
will be your identity proof.

64
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.075
That's something that
identifies you and only you.

65
00:03:14.075 --> 00:03:16.910
But after identifying
yourself you need to

66
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.080
authenticate that you are

67
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.970
actually who you
are saying you are.

68
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.265
Basically that's done
through the password,

69
00:03:23.265 --> 00:03:25.890
so the password will give
you authentication and

70
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.490
your username will give
you identification.

71
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.130
Kerberos it's a protocol used
for implementing cosine on.

72
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.040
There are some mutual
authentication like CHAP,

73
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.020
these are some type of

74
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.910
authentication processes that are

75
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.665
used to communicate to systems.

76
00:03:45.665 --> 00:03:48.660
They are rely on a [inaudible].

77
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.430
More specifically
in active directory

78
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.570
we have something called

79
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.675
Security ID and this basically

80
00:03:57.675 --> 00:04:01.770
it's a unique ID given
to objects and subjects.

81
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.635
We mean it's an ID
that identifies

82
00:04:04.635 --> 00:04:06.650
a person and also it's

83
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.870
able to identify
an object meaning,

84
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.410
for example, a specific group
or a specific file.

85
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.410
Most of the operating
systems that

86
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.225
we know use Discretionary
Access Controls,

87
00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:21.680
basically the Discretionary
Access Control

88
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.010
is a type of access
control that allows

89
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.810
the users to give access

90
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.235
to their own data to
whomever they want.

91
00:04:30.235 --> 00:04:33.930
Meaning if I have a text file
or a sensitive data,

92
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.540
I'm responsible for who

93
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.080
is allowed to view and edit
that file because it's

94
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.840
my file and it's
discretionary to me to give

95
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.940
that access to anyone
that I want to.
