00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.695
In this video, you will learn to;

2
00:00:07.695 --> 00:00:11.175
describe a penetration
testing process,

3
00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:14.160
Mile-2 CPTE training,

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.860
and what is meant
by ethical hacking.

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.445
Part of this session is
the penetration testing process.

6
00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:22.785
The penetration testing phases

7
00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:27.315
that in the audit
we just understand,

8
00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:29.830
for example, that we don't
have the web system.

9
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.680
We don't have any assessment
yet to understand

10
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.690
or to review if the system is

11
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.880
prone to cross-site scripting.

12
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.430
Well, on that pentesting site,

13
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.680
we will go and we will

14
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.155
test the cross-site
scripting into the system.

15
00:00:45.155 --> 00:00:48.405
We will act like an attacker,

16
00:00:48.405 --> 00:00:49.619
like in a hacker,

17
00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:51.345
and try to explore the system,

18
00:00:51.345 --> 00:00:53.955
try to perform
the cross-site scripting

19
00:00:53.955 --> 00:00:55.755
and understand what happens.

20
00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:57.869
Understand if the system

21
00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:00.650
is prone to cross-site scripting.

22
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.365
Well, let's simulate,
let's attack the system,

23
00:01:03.365 --> 00:01:05.525
let's generate
the cross-site scripting

24
00:01:05.525 --> 00:01:07.130
attack into the system,

25
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.070
and let's see what happened.

26
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.325
Let's see if the system,

27
00:01:10.325 --> 00:01:13.280
let me send a message to a user,

28
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.140
and let me, through the user,

29
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.260
to go to an external
website and try

30
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.840
to hack the user's computer,

31
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.195
try to hack the system.

32
00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:26.525
So basically,
the penetration testing or

33
00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:28.595
the ethical hacking
process this is

34
00:01:28.595 --> 00:01:31.585
just methodology used by Mile-2,

35
00:01:31.585 --> 00:01:33.710
is a vendor that has

36
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.410
a lot of cybersecurity
certification,

37
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.440
but this is just a basic
and the standard process.

38
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.510
So you will need to footprinting

39
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.550
your target on the same target

40
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.830
that we have the web
application program.

41
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.050
We will need to
understand first of all,

42
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.000
what kind of system
we are dealing with,

43
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.150
if this is a web
system or dealing

44
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.670
with the WordPress platform,

45
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.250
we're dealing with
a customized platform,

46
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.355
we're dealing with
HTML5 platform.

47
00:02:01.355 --> 00:02:04.280
The scanning planning process
will let us know

48
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.490
or in the Pentester view,

49
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.045
we'll give the Pentester

50
00:02:12.045 --> 00:02:16.755
the knowledge to understand
if there is any port open.

51
00:02:16.755 --> 00:02:18.585
What is the operative system

52
00:02:18.585 --> 00:02:21.930
of the web server application?

53
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.565
What is the language?

54
00:02:23.565 --> 00:02:25.440
What is the database that

55
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.145
the web application
is reporting to?

56
00:02:29.145 --> 00:02:31.220
On the enumeration, we will

57
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.230
understand any kind
of techniques,

58
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.140
any kind of processes that
we are going to generate,

59
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.695
that we're going to use
for the access system.

60
00:02:39.695 --> 00:02:43.520
Obviously, we have the
exploitation or penetration part,

61
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.440
and these means that we're
going to perform the attacks.

62
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.155
We're going to generate
get the attacks.

63
00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:49.480
If we understand that we are

64
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.080
dealing with
a WordPress platform,

65
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.585
and the WordPress platform

66
00:02:52.585 --> 00:02:55.515
is in a server in
the internal network

67
00:02:55.515 --> 00:02:58.950
and the same WordPress platform

68
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.305
prompts to a SQL
injection attack,

69
00:03:01.305 --> 00:03:04.310
and we could get the information
for the database.

70
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.290
Well, let's generate the attack,

71
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.270
let's create the attack
and see what happen.

72
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.310
If the attack was successful,

73
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.650
we will have to perform
a set of steps.

74
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.249
For example, we could
elevate the privilege,

75
00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:20.355
we could manipulated the data.

76
00:03:20.355 --> 00:03:22.170
We need to cover our tracks.

77
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.165
For example, we don't want for

78
00:03:24.165 --> 00:03:29.195
that CSEC to detect
our steps in the system.

79
00:03:29.195 --> 00:03:33.415
So probably, we will need
to cover our tracks.

80
00:03:33.415 --> 00:03:36.530
We will have to leave a backdoor.

81
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.895
For example, we will want to

82
00:03:37.895 --> 00:03:39.770
come back later to the system,

83
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.550
and we don't want to perform
any of the previous steps.

84
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.770
We just want to go
and double-click on

85
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.035
the LinkIn in our Desktop and
get access to the system,

86
00:03:50.035 --> 00:03:52.545
then we will need to
leave a backdoor.

87
00:03:52.545 --> 00:03:54.740
Those processes, those steps,

88
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.140
we'll understand or will give us

89
00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.705
an understanding that the
system is prone to attacks,

90
00:04:00.705 --> 00:04:02.735
and not just prone to attack but

91
00:04:02.735 --> 00:04:05.600
the system will have
or will deal with

92
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.120
attacks in a way
that will give the

93
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.910
attacker the full control
of the system,

94
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.070
or will block the attack and

95
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.520
will drop all the connections
from the attacker computer.

96
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.860
So that process,

97
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.280
the pentest process
is normally known

98
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.040
as an offensive security scan,

99
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.530
is something that you will
need to act like an attacker,

100
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.180
you will need to act as

101
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.590
a hacker and perform
attacks into systems.

102
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.520
Obviously, you will need
to have permission from

103
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.605
your client in order to proceed
with these kind of test.

104
00:04:42.605 --> 00:04:44.740
But on the audit,

105
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.450
the important part here is

106
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.405
understand that if you
will perform an audit,

107
00:04:50.405 --> 00:04:52.820
this is not necessarily
a pentest or

108
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.685
a pentest is not
necessarily an audit.

109
00:04:55.685 --> 00:04:57.949
So there is a lot of differences,

110
00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.170
there is a lot of things that

111
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.330
you will keep in mind in order to

112
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.025
perform each of both or
each of the processes,

113
00:05:07.025 --> 00:05:12.290
each of the techniques that
we show you in the session.
