00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.700
In this video, you
will learn to describe

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.670
which compliance policies
most organizations

3
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.635
are required to follow,

4
00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:18.225
described the use of audits
in cybersecurity compliance.

5
00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:22.065
We go to compliance.
Here's a quick example of

6
00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:26.580
couple of regulation
or compliance policies

7
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.530
that most of the organizations in

8
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.500
the United States or in
other parts of the world

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.065
need to have or to

10
00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:36.870
implement in order to
operate certain countries.

11
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.400
So for example we have SOX.

12
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.975
SOX is a financial

13
00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:42.930
compliance or financial
regulation program.

14
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.790
HIPPA, we already
mentioned HIPPA.

15
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.975
It's something related
to healthcare,

16
00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:50.460
how the healthcare or
organizations deal with

17
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.995
the privacy of data of
their patients, for example,

18
00:00:53.995 --> 00:00:57.110
how they transmit the data
between hospitals,

19
00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.280
different healthcare
organizations and for example,

20
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.960
if they transmit the information

21
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.445
in a secure way for example.

22
00:01:04.445 --> 00:01:08.055
GLBA is something
related to finance.

23
00:01:08.055 --> 00:01:11.750
PCI/DSS, these are related to

24
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.180
the manage of credit cards
of financial processes.

25
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.060
So if you want, for example,

26
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.980
to start processing
credit cards on

27
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.510
your servers because you
have an online store,

28
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.755
probably you will need
to comply with PCI/DSS.

29
00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:34.460
Normally, a lot of companies
that deals with PCI/DSS,

30
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.605
it's to perform, for example,

31
00:01:36.605 --> 00:01:40.010
Panthers or [inaudible]
assessment on regular basis

32
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.670
for them to comply with PCI/DSS.

33
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.510
So here's just examples
for their compliance.

34
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.860
One of the last part
that are important to

35
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.020
understand is the main difference

36
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.915
between the process that
any organization could

37
00:01:59.915 --> 00:02:02.960
perform in order to identify if

38
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.045
they are compliant with
a certain regulation

39
00:02:06.045 --> 00:02:09.950
or a certain framework that
they want to implement.

40
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.220
One of the things that they
need to perform is an audit.

41
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.050
Now an audit could be

42
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.885
an internal audit or it
could be an external audit.

43
00:02:17.885 --> 00:02:19.910
The internal audit is obviously

44
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.370
performed by
internal departments,

45
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.880
by internal audit department and

46
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.460
that's something normal with
most of the organizations.

47
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.870
That's a continuing process,

48
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.839
that's something that
is normally performed

49
00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:37.355
during all the year,
during audit life-cycle.

50
00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:39.875
But the difference here is

51
00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:43.130
normally the internal
departments will generate

52
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.320
reports but those reports are

53
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.860
necessarily to improve the
operation of the organization.

54
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.750
The external audits are
normally based on requirements.

55
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.970
So for example, if
you want to comply

56
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.045
with PCI DSS you will need to

57
00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:04.730
hire an external audit company
to generate a report

58
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.180
and understand in which of

59
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.094
the PCI DSS part you
are not complying,

60
00:03:12.094 --> 00:03:16.085
or if you are complying in
all that PCI DSS parts,

61
00:03:16.085 --> 00:03:18.830
while the external company will

62
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.560
let you know on the report
that you are able or

63
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.620
you can go now and apply for
a PCI DSS certification or

64
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.380
process to be a part
of or to start

65
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.415
dealing with credit
cards for example.

66
00:03:34.415 --> 00:03:39.480
Now here is a methodology

67
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.565
which you could use in
your audit projects for example.

68
00:03:44.565 --> 00:03:47.030
Basically these processes could

69
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.550
apply for external
and internal audits,

70
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.040
but are actually pretty
simple with three phases.

71
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.050
But inside each of the phases,

72
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.550
you will have a bunch of

73
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.310
steps and again this is
something to standard.

74
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.480
So it not necessarily means
that the same methodology

75
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.220
will be applied or will

76
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.290
be valid for
all the organization.

77
00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.270
But this is just the baseline.

78
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.160
So on phase one,

79
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.040
you will have to understand
the organization view,

80
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.465
you will need to understand

81
00:04:15.465 --> 00:04:17.685
the organization that
you are dealing with,

82
00:04:17.685 --> 00:04:21.585
you will need to identify
the key players,

83
00:04:21.585 --> 00:04:24.650
the key users for example
of system in motive to

84
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.980
start looking for any finding,

85
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.700
any incident or issue that

86
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.795
you may report in
your final audit report.

87
00:04:35.795 --> 00:04:38.180
Also you will need
to create a profile,

88
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.160
you will need to create
a threat profile.

89
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.950
For example if you are
auditing a software,

90
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.705
you will need to understand well,

91
00:04:44.705 --> 00:04:47.510
this is a web-based software and

92
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.450
one of the threats that
the software could have,

93
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.445
is cross-site scripting attack.

94
00:04:52.445 --> 00:04:57.315
So it doesn't mean that
the software that you are

95
00:04:57.315 --> 00:04:59.610
auditing right now is prone

96
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.840
to or have an issue regarding
cross-site scripting.

97
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.015
But that's something that in

98
00:05:05.015 --> 00:05:08.060
phase number two and
phase number three,

99
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.255
you will need to assess and
you will need to identify.

100
00:05:11.255 --> 00:05:15.905
So again if you know that you
are dealing with a web page

101
00:05:15.905 --> 00:05:18.200
or the web software will

102
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.780
be prone to a cross-site
scripting attack.

103
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.370
On phase number two,

104
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.925
you will need to evaluate,

105
00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:26.840
you will need to
understand and you will

106
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.730
need to debt or probably

107
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.775
interview to the creators
of software and

108
00:05:31.775 --> 00:05:33.515
ask if they are already

109
00:05:33.515 --> 00:05:36.020
perform any kind of
app for example,

110
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.860
Security Review on
the web system,

111
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.050
on the web application
and the results of

112
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.410
the review will have

113
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.670
something regarding
cross-site scripting.

114
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:53.555
If there is any security review
for that web system,

115
00:05:53.555 --> 00:05:58.070
probably you will need
to create your own test,

116
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.180
your own assessment or you
will need to inform on

117
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.250
your report that
this software doesn't

118
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.720
have any security review.

119
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.640
That will guarantee
that is truthful for

120
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.105
example and the last part

121
00:06:14.105 --> 00:06:16.550
is the risk assessment.
The risk analysis.

122
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.815
That process will translate

123
00:06:18.815 --> 00:06:23.045
all your findings in
your audit report, into a risk.

124
00:06:23.045 --> 00:06:26.330
This could be on the example

125
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.810
that we are talking about
the cross-site scripting,

126
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:34.765
if you detect that
the organization is not

127
00:06:34.765 --> 00:06:39.350
performing any security
assessment and you don't have

128
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.650
any widths or any evidence
that will let you know that,

129
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.390
yes, this software is not
prone to cross-site scripting.

130
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:53.115
Well. You need to categorize
that finding into a risk.

131
00:06:53.115 --> 00:06:56.145
Is this a high risk
for your organization?

132
00:06:56.145 --> 00:06:58.325
Well. If your business depends

133
00:06:58.325 --> 00:07:02.385
on that web system
probably it's a high-risk,

134
00:07:02.385 --> 00:07:04.430
probably it's a critical risk.

135
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.050
So you will need to understand,

136
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.690
you will need to translate
those findings into risk.
