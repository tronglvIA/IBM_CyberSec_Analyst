00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.050
In this video, you will learn

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.530
to describe the purpose
of frameworks,

3
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.960
baselines, and best practices in

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.410
an effective
cybersecurity strategy.

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.245
The last part of the session is

6
00:00:19.245 --> 00:00:22.950
frameworks and their purposes.

7
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.590
We're going to talk
about frameworks,

8
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.295
we're going to talk
about best practices.

9
00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:33.315
Here are just a good
differentiation

10
00:00:33.315 --> 00:00:35.055
between best practices,

11
00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:38.325
baseline, frameworks,
normative, and compliance.

12
00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:40.935
So in the organization,

13
00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:43.485
we will have a lot of things,

14
00:00:43.485 --> 00:00:46.080
we will have, for
example, best practices,

15
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.400
we will have a baseline or
we will have framework.

16
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.015
A good example of
framework is COBIT

17
00:00:52.015 --> 00:00:55.980
or a good example
of best practices,

18
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.960
in some cases,
framework depends of

19
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.985
your business is I-T-I-L, ITIL.

20
00:01:02.985 --> 00:01:05.910
So those are good things,

21
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.745
good controls that will improve,

22
00:01:08.745 --> 00:01:11.520
enhance your IT governance,

23
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.770
your IT processes, your IT
policies, your IT procedures.

24
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.530
Those frameworks,
those baselines,

25
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.195
those best practices will

26
00:01:22.195 --> 00:01:24.560
improve the performance
of your servers.

27
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.510
For example, if you go and

28
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.000
grab the best practices
for Microsoft

29
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.535
regarding the hardening of

30
00:01:31.535 --> 00:01:34.280
their database server
for example,

31
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.130
you will have a best
Microsoft SQL Server,

32
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.560
you will have an improved
Microsoft SQL Server.

33
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.170
But that best practice,

34
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.850
that framework it's not

35
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.230
something that you
will have to have,

36
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.625
it's nice to have.

37
00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:50.400
You will have a lot
of good practices,

38
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.900
you will have a lot of controls,

39
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.700
you will have a lot
of good things,

40
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.200
but if you don't
have it, that's it.

41
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.099
That's something that will

42
00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:01.955
not necessarily
harm your business.

43
00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.920
If you don't have guidelines from

44
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.800
Microsoft to implement
the servers,

45
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.670
if you don't have the guidelines

46
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.540
from Cisco to implement
the physical devices,

47
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.870
if you don't have
the best practices from

48
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.894
COBIT to improve your IP
governance in your company,

49
00:02:19.894 --> 00:02:22.535
you will loose your business,

50
00:02:22.535 --> 00:02:25.715
you will be part of
many kind of problem

51
00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:29.255
with your regulator,
with your government.

52
00:02:29.255 --> 00:02:30.600
In the other corner,

53
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.360
we have normative and compliance.

54
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.920
The difference here is you
need to implement normative,

55
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.140
you need to have

56
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.485
compliance if your business
required that.

57
00:02:42.485 --> 00:02:46.065
So for example, there is
something called HIPAA.

58
00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:49.760
HIPAA is normative
that will be part

59
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.050
of any kind of health care
company in United States.

60
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.350
So in your health care company,

61
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.580
you could have COBIT,

62
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.310
you could have a lot
of ITIL processes,

63
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.710
you could have
all the best practices from

64
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.965
your burn vendors
implemented in your systems,

65
00:03:06.965 --> 00:03:11.735
but if you don't
comply with HIPAA,

66
00:03:11.735 --> 00:03:13.220
if you missed two points,

67
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.235
if you missed
two processes in HIPAA,

68
00:03:15.235 --> 00:03:18.300
probably you won't
operate in United States.

69
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.330
You will have penalties from

70
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.370
the US government because you are

71
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.220
not complying with HIPAA.

72
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.865
So that's the main difference
between baselines,

73
00:03:28.865 --> 00:03:30.550
frameworks, and best practices,

74
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.655
and normative, and compliance.

75
00:03:32.655 --> 00:03:34.140
So as we mentioned,

76
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.760
we have a lot of things, we have,

77
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.030
for example, as
best practices, as frameworks,

78
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.040
methodologies that we could

79
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.400
implement in our business
to improve the way

80
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.215
that our business fills

81
00:03:45.215 --> 00:03:48.005
with technology and
we could mention,

82
00:03:48.005 --> 00:03:50.045
actually, we already
mentioned a couple of those.

83
00:03:50.045 --> 00:03:51.590
We could mention COBIT,

84
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.510
we can mention ITIL, ISOs.

85
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.485
Cyber Security we have

86
00:03:56.485 --> 00:04:02.595
the ISOs 27,000
series, we have COSO,

87
00:04:02.595 --> 00:04:04.170
we have the PMI,

88
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.180
the Project Management
Institute with

89
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.730
a lot of project
management methodologies,

90
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.190
we have the developer
recommendations.

91
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.360
As soon as you start working

92
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.320
with a programming languages,

93
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.730
which you will have a lot
of recommendations,

94
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.690
you will have a lot
of information

95
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.480
regarding the best practices
that you could follow on

96
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.225
your software in your systems

97
00:04:26.225 --> 00:04:29.540
to avoid any kind of
security incidents,

98
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.330
any kind of incident
that will harm

99
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.360
or will destroy your software.
