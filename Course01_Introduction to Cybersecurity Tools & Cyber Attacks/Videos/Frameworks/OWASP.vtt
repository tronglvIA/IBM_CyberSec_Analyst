00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.840
In this video, you will learn

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.250
to describe the OWASP
Top 10 tests,

3
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.320
when and why they are used,

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.725
and where to get help from
outside organizations.

5
00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:19.980
Another methodology,
another best practice

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.980
that most of the web
applications need to follow,

7
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.170
here is the OWASP Top 10 process.

8
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.110
So if you're dealing
with a webpage,

9
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.700
if you're dealing
with web application,

10
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.110
if you are dealing with

11
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.360
actually not necessarily
a web application,

12
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.600
but if you are dealing
with applications at all,

13
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.060
you could use the OWASP Top 10,

14
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.050
and it start performing test
of each of the sections that

15
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.490
the organization will
have on their website.

16
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.190
So basically OWASP, we will see

17
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.835
here a lot of
information on OWASP.

18
00:00:53.835 --> 00:01:00.510
If you go to Google and put
OWASP on the search bar,

19
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.725
you will go to the
owasp.org link,

20
00:01:04.725 --> 00:01:07.100
and you will get a lot
of information regarding

21
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.620
these organization
that will help you

22
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.100
when you are trying
to perform a test

23
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.595
into your web application.

24
00:01:15.595 --> 00:01:18.650
Actually, there is also a lot of

25
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.960
information for
mobile applications too.

26
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.505
So for example, if
you go to download,

27
00:01:26.505 --> 00:01:28.550
you will see a lot
of categories here.

28
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.485
So for example, let's go to

29
00:01:30.485 --> 00:01:34.300
the OWASP Top 10 project here.

30
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.145
You will see that the top 10

31
00:01:38.145 --> 00:01:41.510
for 2017, it's now available.

32
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.435
So here you will load the report

33
00:01:44.435 --> 00:01:47.570
with all the different
information for

34
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.485
the top 10 vulnerability
for the web applications

35
00:01:51.485 --> 00:01:57.195
on the last 2-3 years since 2017.

36
00:01:57.195 --> 00:02:00.270
So for example, we have as
the Number 1 injection.

37
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.550
So if we go to page Number 7,

38
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.510
here is an example of
what is injection?

39
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.260
What is the process to
get information for

40
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.200
the system using
SQL injection for example?

41
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.300
What are the attackers scenarios?

42
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.160
What is that you need to

43
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.050
perform in the system in order to

44
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.060
know if your system is

45
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.375
prompt or is vulnerable
to injection?

46
00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:26.240
You have, for example,
broken authentication,

47
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.770
sensitive data exposure, you have

48
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.295
a lot of things to prove.

49
00:02:32.295 --> 00:02:35.655
Again, if you go to
the main website,

50
00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:38.250
you will see a lot of
the OWASP or something

51
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.180
else known as the checklist.

52
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.480
It's a document where you
will get a lot of document,

53
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.700
a lot of controls that you
will need to implement,

54
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.885
you will need to have on
your web applications

55
00:02:50.885 --> 00:02:52.490
in order to ensure that

56
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.480
your web app is fully secure.
