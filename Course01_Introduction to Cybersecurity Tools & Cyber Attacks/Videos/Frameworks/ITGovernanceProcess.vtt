00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.455
In this video, you will learn to

2
00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:11.520
describe what is meant by
an IT governance process,

3
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.730
what components are involved
and why it is important.

4
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.355
We have the things
that are part of

5
00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:20.325
our organization to put our
something good to have.

6
00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:22.935
Good to understand and well,

7
00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:24.990
it's good to have but
in most of the cases,

8
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.630
aren't necessarily to have.

9
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.090
We have strategic
and tactic plans.

10
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.115
That plans which set
all the direction of

11
00:00:34.115 --> 00:00:37.054
the organization or the structure

12
00:00:37.054 --> 00:00:38.995
of each of the departments.

13
00:00:38.995 --> 00:00:41.705
Each department will try to

14
00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:45.005
obtain the goals using
the strategic plan,

15
00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:47.690
because the strategic plan
will tell you what

16
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.645
is the cause of the company.

17
00:00:50.645 --> 00:00:53.060
If the company wants
to grow for example

18
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.260
20 percent in the next two years
selling computers, well,

19
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.430
probably older departments
inside our company needs to

20
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.810
focus their efforts to
accomplish that strategic goal.

21
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.850
The tactic plans are how could

22
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.000
we accomplish the strategic part.

23
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.640
So those two plans
are hand by hand.

24
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.620
So that's also important
to understand.

25
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.240
Policies are actually
pretty important.

26
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.780
You will need to have
a policy to set the baseline,

27
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.690
to set the structure of
buses that you want to have.

28
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.605
So for example, here
is a quick sample.

29
00:01:36.605 --> 00:01:40.610
You have your business internet
access for your users.

30
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.140
So first thing that
you have to have or

31
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.290
you have to have or
you need to have

32
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.860
actually, is the policy.

33
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.120
How the users will
access the internet,

34
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.035
what their users can do and
cannot do on their internet.

35
00:01:58.035 --> 00:02:02.480
So a user Internet
policy should be in

36
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.880
place for let the users know

37
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.925
what they cannot do
and what they can do.

38
00:02:07.925 --> 00:02:09.910
Now there is a procedure,

39
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.155
a procedure is for example what

40
00:02:12.155 --> 00:02:15.830
a new user should do
in-order to have internet.

41
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.025
So it doesn't matter
at this point.

42
00:02:19.025 --> 00:02:21.710
For example, you need a
procedure if the users can't go

43
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.070
to a sports website
and watch a game.

44
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.830
But the procedure,
this scenario will allow

45
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.180
the user to request

46
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.210
internet access to
the IT expert for example.

47
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.440
As soon as the user has
perhaps internet access,

48
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.740
the user will probably
prompt to read

49
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.880
the Internet usage
policy and the user

50
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.900
will need to accept the policy in

51
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.145
order to get internet access.

52
00:02:49.145 --> 00:02:52.250
That's something that we
normally use or we normally

53
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.150
experiment on the public
internet access locations.

54
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.030
So for example if
you go to Starbucks

55
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.320
and your are trying

56
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.770
to use the Internet
access from Starbucks,

57
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.520
as soon as you connect
to your Wi-Fi network,

58
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.009
you will receive a captive portal

59
00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:14.630
with a lot of information,

60
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.535
a lot of data that

61
00:03:16.535 --> 00:03:19.690
says in other words that
all the information,

62
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.515
all the data that you
are going to send using

63
00:03:24.515 --> 00:03:29.510
that Wi-Fi connection will

64
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.245
not have any responsible
of responsibility in that.

65
00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:35.434
So that's a quick example

66
00:03:35.434 --> 00:03:37.670
of what is a policy and
what is a procedure.

67
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.080
The procedure is again,

68
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.310
the process that you need to

69
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.830
follow in order to
have something,

70
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.840
in order to perform something.

71
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.050
The policy is simply

72
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.630
the rules that you will
need to understand,

73
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.280
that you will need to accept to

74
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.440
start using your computer,

75
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.870
your Internet, your device.

76
00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.700
Governance, governance
is the understanding

77
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.400
of all the different parts

78
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.465
of the organization
with one unique goal.

79
00:04:11.465 --> 00:04:14.705
So for example, copied
is a good framework

80
00:04:14.705 --> 00:04:18.410
that allows your
company to improve

81
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.115
their IT governance into
your organization because

82
00:04:22.115 --> 00:04:23.615
all the different parts of

83
00:04:23.615 --> 00:04:26.240
your organization will
talk the same language.

84
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.190
So for example, if somebody in

85
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.875
accounting needs a modification

86
00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:36.360
on the payroll system
because they fund a buck,

87
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.340
they know that if they want

88
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.500
a modification in
the system they will need

89
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.790
to therefore go to

90
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.655
their internet and
create ticket number,

91
00:04:44.655 --> 00:04:46.740
create an incident case.

92
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.870
That incident will go

93
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.040
to the IPA staff and
the IPA staff will

94
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.490
prioritize the incident into

95
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.715
the queue to be treated
by the experts,

96
00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:01.535
that's something actually
pretty centered.

97
00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:03.894
But everything that I mentioned,

98
00:05:03.894 --> 00:05:07.065
it's part of the IT
governance process.

99
00:05:07.065 --> 00:05:11.165
That may correspond to
a change management process,

100
00:05:11.165 --> 00:05:16.895
to a delivery and support
process from your IPA staff.

101
00:05:16.895 --> 00:05:20.510
That's a good example of how

102
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.865
your accounting department that

103
00:05:22.865 --> 00:05:26.194
probably doesn't have anything
to do with technology,

104
00:05:26.194 --> 00:05:30.635
needs to understand and talk
the same language that your

105
00:05:30.635 --> 00:05:32.585
IT department in order to

106
00:05:32.585 --> 00:05:36.060
all departments have
the same goals.
