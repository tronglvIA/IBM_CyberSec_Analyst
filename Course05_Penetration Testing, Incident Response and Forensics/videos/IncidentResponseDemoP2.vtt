00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.565
Welcome to Incident
Response Demo:

2
00:00:02.565 --> 00:00:05.040
Part 3 brought to you by IBM.

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.570
[inaudible] here is older,

4
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.650
going to go ahead and
take a look at it.

5
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.995
It also has a pretty
high severity

6
00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:22.990
even though the
credibility is low.

7
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.780
So the first thing
I notice here is

8
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.015
the event name, file infected,

9
00:00:29.015 --> 00:00:30.770
no cleaner available,

10
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.260
OAS is denied access
to the command.

11
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.725
On the Summary page as
you can see here there's

12
00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:43.895
a file was infected and
there's no cleaner available.

13
00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:47.790
Therefore, check the events.

14
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.250
It looks like a virus was
detected on this machine.

15
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:08.040
You have the source IP, and

16
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.950
then we can also find
the file name in here.

17
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.395
We found the file,

18
00:01:13.395 --> 00:01:15.500
and it looks like it's
actually triggering

19
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.000
on a file that is
in the recycle bin.

20
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.350
[inaudible] copied that out

21
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.970
[inaudible] starting 0 response,

22
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.825
scurry down the time,

23
00:01:29.825 --> 00:01:32.640
you've some detailed notes.

24
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.100
Once I've identified the
system, identify the file,

25
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.230
when he got in contact and

26
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.245
our team again get that
switchboard disabled.

27
00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:55.060
Once I submitted that ticket to

28
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.015
the network team to
have the port disabled,

29
00:01:58.015 --> 00:02:00.490
I'm going to go ahead
and look back on

30
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.940
my list of individuals
to contact,

31
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.000
that we created in step one,

32
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.890
events and their response,

33
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.015
where we prepared the
shareholders list

34
00:02:13.015 --> 00:02:15.620
in the event of an attack.

35
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.650
Once I contact them,

36
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.040
I am going to go
over and kick off

37
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.610
my AVScan and wait
for the results.

38
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.100
So once I kick off
my AVScan and we're

39
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.440
going to go ahead and
fill out the rest

40
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.910
in the response form at anyone
notes in here that I have.

41
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.085
Once I've completed the
AVScan, I come back.

42
00:02:41.085 --> 00:02:43.815
The file wasn't removed,
it's still there.

43
00:02:43.815 --> 00:02:47.475
it also detected a
few other files.

44
00:02:47.475 --> 00:02:49.370
I'm going to recommend that this

45
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.735
is the mirror image as well.

46
00:02:50.735 --> 00:02:54.500
So we suddenly IAM
and those wacky tells

47
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.570
us how you're going
to go ahead and

48
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.710
re-image it with apple.

49
00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:59.790
Finally, we want to go ahead and

50
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.190
do an after-action report,

51
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.875
and an after-action report
can be just are running.

52
00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:11.630
Add document, but keep a list of

53
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.375
mistakes or efficiencies that

54
00:03:14.375 --> 00:03:16.325
that happened during
answer response.

55
00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:20.435
The first incident that we
completed for the DNS query,

56
00:03:20.435 --> 00:03:23.390
I looked at the events
and then I went and

57
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.600
what that DNS query to
see if it was malicious,

58
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.250
and then I had to go
back to the events to

59
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.650
see if it was
actually successful.

60
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.870
So something I could
have done to improve

61
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.845
my efficiency is when I
looked at the events,

62
00:03:39.845 --> 00:03:41.900
I could have ensured that it

63
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.115
was successful before
I even looked it up,

64
00:03:45.115 --> 00:03:47.960
if the DNS would have been
bought by a DNS server,

65
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.085
then I would've wasted the
time go and look up that IP.

66
00:03:52.085 --> 00:03:55.820
Another thing that I didn't
do in the first one was,

67
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.995
I didn't know any
of my shareholders

68
00:03:57.995 --> 00:03:59.480
until anyone that I was going

69
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.070
through that center response.

70
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.945
Then in the second one,

71
00:04:02.945 --> 00:04:07.745
which was for the DOS attack,

72
00:04:07.745 --> 00:04:10.040
there was a lot of events there,

73
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.980
I didn't look to see
if there was maybe

74
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.240
multiple source
addresses or maybe it

75
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.920
wasn't even the developers
that were logged in,

76
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.580
somebody else, but I

77
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.365
didn't do a full
investigation there,

78
00:04:30.365 --> 00:04:34.050
and definitely something that

79
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.040
might have wanted to look
a little further into,

80
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.940
[inaudible] after action
review, it's for you to learn,

81
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.505
it's important to
do because it can

82
00:04:43.505 --> 00:04:47.225
improve your response
time drastically.

83
00:04:47.225 --> 00:04:50.030
Just walk through the insulin
response process one more

84
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.605
time and make sure I hit
on the important details.

85
00:04:54.605 --> 00:04:56.510
So that one is preparation.

86
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.580
you want to know what
you're looking for,

87
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.865
what assets you're monitoring?

88
00:05:00.865 --> 00:05:03.740
Events that you are
going to trigger on

89
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.875
and start down that
incident response path,

90
00:05:06.875 --> 00:05:08.930
as well as the people to contact

91
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.300
in the case of an incident.

92
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.850
Subdue [inaudible] and
responsive detection and

93
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.340
analysis and similar
response detection and

94
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.305
analysis begins with
getting the word

95
00:05:18.305 --> 00:05:21.140
and then beginning to
gather information

96
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.530
and research the events
that had triggered

97
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.960
the alert and
determining if it is

98
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.010
a relevant or if it's
a false positive,

99
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.895
as well as determining how
large is this incident,

100
00:05:34.895 --> 00:05:36.440
stuff or events
that are responses,

101
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.840
containment, eradication,
and recovery.

102
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.320
For the first one, the
containment portion

103
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.250
is to disconnect it
from the network.

104
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.955
If it's a workstation,

105
00:05:48.955 --> 00:05:52.255
it's easy to walk over and
pull the cable out of all.

106
00:05:52.255 --> 00:05:55.210
If it's something
like a server or VM,

107
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.100
you have to contact that team

108
00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.650
that's responsible for
those network connections.

109
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.440
The two incidents that we
wrote up the report for,

110
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.040
we did the same lit
using the network team,

111
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.145
typically that's
the quickest way.

112
00:06:12.145 --> 00:06:14.560
You don't know where that
workstation ends or,

113
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.170
it's across the
building or something.

114
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.265
Then after you contain it,

115
00:06:21.265 --> 00:06:23.015
you want to eradicate it.

116
00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:26.070
I'm sure you'll look
for other threats,

117
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.100
make sure that file
is not in place

118
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.140
on the share and it's being
copied all over the place,

119
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.520
and then make sure that system
is not communicating over

120
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.760
other systems more
than it normally does

121
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.645
or on a different board
then it normally does.

122
00:06:41.645 --> 00:06:43.595
Then the last step is recovery.

123
00:06:43.595 --> 00:06:47.910
So you'll want to get the
system back to in state.

124
00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.390
Typically approval asked me,

125
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.639
you'll learn from the Manager

126
00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:54.560
to allow that says the
MAC on the network

127
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.715
or give direction and say
[inaudible] in our case,

128
00:06:59.715 --> 00:07:03.615
both of the incidence needed
the system re-imaged.

129
00:07:03.615 --> 00:07:05.580
Last but not least,

130
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.100
the post incident activity,

131
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.920
part of incident
response system four.

132
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.960
So in the after action report,

133
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.420
by end notes and earlier,

134
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.460
just want to add any
mistakes in there,

135
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.375
anything that you can do
better than the thing that

136
00:07:20.375 --> 00:07:22.640
will make your response time more

137
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.650
efficient. Thanks for watching.
