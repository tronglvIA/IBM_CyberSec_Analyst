00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.505
Welcome to Incident Response Demo Part 2,
brought to you by IBM.

2
00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:08.068
Offenses are created when
a rule is triggered and

3
00:00:08.068 --> 00:00:10.960
the action is set to create an offense.

4
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.540
As you can see we, have three offenses
listed in the QRadar interface now.

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.870
This is the curator offense interface.

6
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.460
Inside the curator offense
interface it lists out any

7
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.912
offenses that the QRadar
rules engine has alerted on.

8
00:00:25.912 --> 00:00:27.510
We have a few different ones here.

9
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.680
The quickest way to determine
priority is by the magnitude,

10
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.150
and we can look at that by just
placing our mouse over the bar graph.

11
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.445
As you can see there, the the first one's

12
00:00:41.445 --> 00:00:46.497
a magnitude five,
second's a magnitude four.

13
00:00:46.497 --> 00:00:49.157
And these are all going to be the same,
and

14
00:00:49.157 --> 00:00:51.830
then this last one's a magnitude three.

15
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.850
So let's go ahead and
check out the magnitude five.

16
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.760
After we click into the offense,
we're given a summary page.

17
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.930
On the summary page it gives us
all kinds of different details,

18
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.030
including the top five Source IPs,

19
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.740
the Destination IPs, which log
sources were involved in the event,

20
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.420
as well as the categories of the events
that were used to create the offense.

21
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.740
One of the main things to look at on
this page is the top five innertations.

22
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.960
The very first one there
is malicious URL detecting.

23
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.900
For this instance of QRadar,
we actually have a rule that is built

24
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.058
to compare DNS queries
against a reference set, and

25
00:01:36.058 --> 00:01:41.150
that reference set has
multiple malicious URLs in it.

26
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.472
If we wanted to drive down further in
this event, we can click on the events.

27
00:01:52.726 --> 00:01:54.660
And we can see the different
events that were triggered.

28
00:01:56.927 --> 00:02:01.391
So it was a DNS in progress
to the DNS server.

29
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:10.899
And once QRadar has seen that and
compared it to the reference set,

30
00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.007
it created its event, and
also created the offense.

31
00:02:18.407 --> 00:02:23.834
All right, so now that we've seen
the events that caused the offense,

32
00:02:23.834 --> 00:02:29.623
let's go ahead and search this DNS name
out on X-Force Exchange and see if it

33
00:02:29.623 --> 00:02:35.343
is rated as malicious, which it should
be since it is in our reference set.

34
00:02:35.343 --> 00:02:37.877
I mean,
unless some things have happened and

35
00:02:37.877 --> 00:02:41.821
somebody else is now hosting that site,
or somebody else now owns it.

36
00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:45.861
Right away out here on X-Force Exchange,
it's listed as a Risk 10.

37
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.430
This one does have a collection.

38
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.410
I've already opened it up here, so
we're just going click over to it.

39
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.980
And for
this URL it's used as part of a malware

40
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.440
exfiltrating credentials via DNS attack.

41
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.533
And one of the command and control

42
00:03:10.533 --> 00:03:16.058
servers for this is Weber.

43
00:03:16.058 --> 00:03:23.170
The DNS does appear to be malicious,
so mockery QRadar and C.

44
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.705
So now that we've confirmed
that it is malicious DNS,

45
00:03:27.705 --> 00:03:32.139
we're going to jump in the loose

46
00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:37.430
events again and confirm that
the query actually didn't happen.

47
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:44.770
Right away I see that the destination IP
is one that's not in our private network.

48
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.760
So that tells me that that
DNS address was resolved.

49
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.880
And it results back to
the 192 203 230.10 address.

50
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.960
At this point, I would kick off
the incident response process

51
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.835
beginning with step two since I've already
prepared my asset list as well as my

52
00:04:08.835 --> 00:04:13.520
shareholders to contact and
the events to trigger on.

53
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:17.360
Already, so I went ahead and

54
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.190
pulled on my incident response form here,
this is just a template.

55
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.940
And to be honest, they all look different.

56
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.040
Some of them actually are in notepad.

57
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.323
The first thing here is
the type of incident.

58
00:04:29.323 --> 00:04:36.923
For the type of incident you want to
put DNS query to known botnet,

59
00:04:36.923 --> 00:04:41.287
all the detection source of QRadar,

60
00:04:41.287 --> 00:04:44.832
the environment was the LAN.

61
00:04:44.832 --> 00:04:50.220
His name is Vlad PC2 to the IP address.

62
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.530
This case it says multiple with
the reason it says multiple is because

63
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:05.620
the workstation queried the DNS server and
then it queried the secondary DNS server.

64
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.316
Then the those DNS servers queried
the outside world to resolve that DNS.

65
00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:19.546
So we want to pick the workstation
IP as it's the one that's affected.

66
00:05:24.412 --> 00:05:28.204
And then once you know
if it's a web server, so

67
00:05:28.204 --> 00:05:32.679
now with the system is a workstation and
the public IP,

68
00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:37.460
fortunately our lab doesn't
currently have a public IP.

69
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.940
So for the public IP, I'll just make
up on let's use Google's DNS server.

70
00:05:47.515 --> 00:05:52.595
The next step is to start writing
down the time we find information and

71
00:05:52.595 --> 00:05:56.445
we complete a part of
the incident response process.

72
00:05:59.715 --> 00:06:06.360
So next thing we do is begin recording
what time we found information.

73
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.292
So the first thing that we-

74
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:21.810
So the next thing that we do is begin
recording what time we found information?

75
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.570
The first thing that we
determined was that it

76
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.205
was a malicious DNS query
found that it was this DNS.

77
00:06:37.482 --> 00:06:42.140
We want to copy that in there and
then continue on so

78
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.970
we found out the DNS query
came from a workstation, so

79
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.040
we can put workstation and
then the IP of the workstation.

80
00:06:52.248 --> 00:06:55.105
We can put the host name in
there if we know it as well.

81
00:06:55.105 --> 00:07:04.814
Identify the asset that
is being malicious.

82
00:07:04.814 --> 00:07:09.460
We identified that it is a malicious URL
identified that it didn't actually go out

83
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.650
and make that request and
the request was successful.

84
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:14.340
It was a result.

85
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:22.220
The next step would be to go ahead and
disconnect it from the network.

86
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.270
So to do that,
we would want to submit a ticket and

87
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.870
have them disconnect the workstations,
switch port or

88
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:36.510
if it's something that's physical we can
walk over and unplug it and then circle

89
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:41.610
back with the network team to
have them disable that port.

90
00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:45.580
So once we submit that ticket
over to them they disable it

91
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:51.990
then we can go ahead and
get started with the antivirus scan and

92
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.170
closing out the incident if
it doesn't mean reimaged.

93
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:04.870
However, in this case since it did reach
out to a botnet even if the AV skin

94
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:10.840
comes back as clean, I still think it's
a good idea to go ahead and reimage it.

95
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.879
But one of the reasons that we'd
want to conduct the AV scan

96
00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:20.431
in what is todetermine if something
else is already on there.

97
00:08:20.431 --> 00:08:23.230
Maybe OES isn't actually detecting

98
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:29.605
the virus and
it just needs a full scan to be detected.

99
00:08:29.605 --> 00:08:34.059
Once the switchboards

100
00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:38.590
disabled, and kick off our AV scan.

101
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:45.120
So once we have our ENS skin kicked off,
we want to go back and we want to

102
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:51.310
tidy up this document just going to
pretend like that AV skin come back.

103
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.790
It was clean.

104
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.230
After that, I would go ahead and
make the call

105
00:08:57.455 --> 00:09:02.185
through interested advice since it
is unknown on a neutral network.

106
00:09:02.185 --> 00:09:07.375
So we don't want any chances of that
being part of our local network.

107
00:09:07.375 --> 00:09:11.765
We don't want it to infect other host or
become part of that bond itself.

108
00:09:11.765 --> 00:09:17.320
And since it is just the workstation,
it's not anything super critical.

109
00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:22.330
It can be reset,
reimaged pretty quickly and no harm done.

110
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:29.510
And after that,
I would send this information up and

111
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:36.310
allow them to process it and
archive it so we have it,

112
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:41.720
we know what will it happen on this day.

113
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:47.730
Once we've completed our investigation we
want to go to close the incident we can

114
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:52.800
go ahead and select a response

115
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:58.200
and we can paste our incident
response form in there.

116
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:05.220
And close the ticket,
close that offense out.

117
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.610
Once it's closed, it will no longer
show up in our active offenses and

118
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.070
then we can move on to the next offense.

119
00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.820
So since these offer your the same
magnitude, we definitely want to

120
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:24.670
check out the the older one in
case it needs a faster response.

121
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:29.820
When I click on the offense
on the summary tab again,

122
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:37.900
we can see the offense source is this IP
address which is a workstation as well.

123
00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:43.490
It's actually the same workstation
as the last offense and

124
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:48.230
we can also see that the long sources

125
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:52.460
that were part of the offense was
QRadar as well as the firewall.

126
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.110
And we can see that the events that

127
00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:03.010
were used to create this offense where
session open and session closed events.

128
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:14.760
And in the annotations it says
that it's a possible DDOS attack.

129
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.910
So we never want to check this one out or
go into events.

130
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:32.190
And since this is a local to local attack,

131
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:36.530
it's a little less relevant.

132
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:43.320
Typically when you see local
to a local DDOS attacks

133
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.830
it's just the user that's
doing his daily job.

134
00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.160
For instance this user
is actually working with

135
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:59.790
the server to develop
an application using an API.

136
00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:04.260
So it's expected to see multiple 443

137
00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.780
session open session closes for
that system from that workstation.

138
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:12.390
So therefore this incident
would be a false positive.

139
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:21.985
A false positive is triggered,
even though the events are typical,

140
00:12:21.985 --> 00:12:28.590
they're normal traffic it might just be
something that's beginning to happen.

141
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:33.810
Or maybe it's a new server that stood up
and the roles just aren't in here yet.

142
00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:37.820
The rules have been modified and
that case we would want to go ahead and

143
00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.600
just tune QRadar.

144
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.610
That means that we can go ahead and
make it.

145
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.907
You can go ahead and close the offense and

146
00:12:44.907 --> 00:12:49.310
we're going to close it as a non-issue and

147
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:53.354
not a false positive just because we
want that rule to stay in QRadar.

148
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.070
Once we modify the rule we
want to make a comment to

149
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.870
say that the threshold
was increased if that's

150
00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:17.560
how you modify that rule to lessen
the amount of false positive cheat.

151
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.350
I'm going to click OK
close that offense out.
