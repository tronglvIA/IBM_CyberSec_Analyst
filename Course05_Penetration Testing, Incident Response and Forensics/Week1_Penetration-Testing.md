Visit the [following link](https://hub.packtpub.com/penetration-testing-rules-of-engagement/) to review the differences between a Black, White, and Grey Hat approach to penetration testing. Make sure to read the sections on Rules of Engagement and Scope. After reviewing the article, visit the [Sans Institute](https://pen-testing.sans.org/resources/downloads) site where you can sign up to access various documents relating to penetration testing. Download and review the Scope and the Rules of Engagement (RoE) worksheets.

Visit the [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/) (CVE’s) and the [National Vulnerabilities Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/general) to read about what the sites are for, and how they are used by cybersecurity professionals. Then visit and sign up for the [annual X-Force Threat Intelligence Index](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-42703) which sheds light on the biggest cyber risks that organizations face today. Lastly, learn about the key features of IBM’s own [Vulnerability Scanner Guardium](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/ibm-guardium-vulnerability-assessment).

We covered the PTES’s guide to reporting thoroughly in the last video. If you are looking for a guide that covers “How to write” instead of “what to write,” visit this link to the [Sans Institute’s whitepaper](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/bestprac/paper/33343) on how to write a penetration testing report.
